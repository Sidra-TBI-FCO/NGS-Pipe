## RNA-Seq Lexogen
The pipeline for RNAseq using lexogen is different from the standard RNAseq using [illumina TruSeq](/HPC%20Scripts/RNAseq/TruSeq). Raw data is processed by Sidra bioinformatics core following the pipeline described in  [Lexogen QuantSeq user quide](https://www.lexogen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/015UG108V0311_QuantSeq-Data-Analysis-Pipeline_2021-05-04.pdf).
