## Whole Genome Sequencing Pipeline
This pipeline explaines the processing of whole genome sequecing raw data from matched normal-tumor cancer samples generated by next generation sequencing. The pipeline of processing whole genome is similar to whole exome, except that variants calling will be from exonic and intronic parts as well.
